# audit_logger.py
# Purpose: Provides a basic security audit logging functionality for a Falcon application.

    def process_request(self, req, resp):
        """
        Process the request before it reaches the resource.

    def process_response(self, req, resp, resource, req_succeeded):
        """
        Process the response after the resource has been called.
        Here we log the response status code.

        try:

# Example usage within a Falcon app
app = falcon.App()

# Add AuditLogger middleware
app.middleware.append(AuditLogger())

# Define a simple resource
class SimpleResource:
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        resp.media = {"message": "Hello, world!"}

# Add the resource
app.add_route('/', SimpleResource())

# The above code sets up a Falcon application with audit logging.
# When the application is run, it will log audit information for every request and response.
